##### INFM600 E-Waste Project Deliverables

Waste Management has been a pressing issue across the globe with an ever-rising population surge and the utilization of daily needs including electronics. As we already are aware of the tenure of these goods and depending on the usage, have a specific lifespan. After these electronics reach the end of life, they are typically discarded the waste disposal which gets accumulated and joins the regular pile of waste that gets shipped and accumulated in dump yards across the globe. We wanted to have the e-waste handled in a much more efficient sense with the urge to have a service that could significantly reduce and recycle the parts and remains of electronic goods after their end of life.

E-waste covers a huge range of products from small equipment like calculators to large equipment like solar panels. These items are growing in huge numbers as individuals and businesses are more technology-oriented with existing and new types of equipment. Our E-waste information service idea would not be just individual specific, it can even be open to businesses. With a world population of 7.98 billion and with ever-growing changes in media and technology, this will not just be a one time thing as it's a cycle of recycling, refurbishing, and reselling.

From an information standpoint, this service should be able to pick up e-waste from homes or business places by having a specific set of order numbers and thoroughly checking and closing the collection orders. Reselling information is a good part of this information service where refurbished components can be put up for sale (at a lower cost) and that itself will have information (on the technical components) and other processes.

This repository highlights our work completed over the semester to help emphasize how E-Waste could potentially be recycled properly through our business R-E-Cycle. We cover our website design through wireframes, how data would flow in our system through Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), how our database (for purchases and selling) would be designed through an Entity Relationship Diagram, and with data visualizations to help emphasize its importance. We have also included a full detailed report on E-Waste as well which has been named our Project Proposal.

We hope you enjoy our work and hopefully R-E-Cycle!
